        Inheritance is when a class inherits functionality from another class. The top class in this structure is
        called the super class, while the classes which inherit are called subclasses or child classes.
        The benefit of inheritance is to hoard generational wealth and thereby perpetuate the unjust class structure
        in society. Rise up, comrades! Ahem... I mean: the benefit of inheritance is that several classes can share
        common functionality and thereby reduce the need for copy-pasting the same code several places, which means
        that the code will be easier to maintain. Subclasses can use and extend the functionality of its super class.
        Using interfaces, we can also create a “contract” with ourselves, that the classes implementing the
        interface(s) must implement certain functionality.
